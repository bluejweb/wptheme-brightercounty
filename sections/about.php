            Megan is a late 20 something girl who lives in the Tennessee Valley. She can usually be found drinking tea out of a mason jar while planning her next adventure. She loves all things fair trade and is slowly trying to lead a more sustainable lifestyle. If she isn't on the road or in the air, she can be found making candles, teaching the worldâ€™s best student, or binge watching Netflix.
